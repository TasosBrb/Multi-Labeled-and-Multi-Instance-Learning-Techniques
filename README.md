In the first part we work on the subject of learning from multi-label data. We apply two learning techniques, 
where the representation of each document concerns the words it includes (bag of words).

In the second part, we work on the problem of learning from "bags" of instances (Multi-Instance Learning). 
We focus on the most frequent of the 20 classes in order to deal with a binary classification problem. 
We think of each document as a "bag" of propositions. We group the sentences of the training set and represent each document based on the groups 
to which its sentences belong. We then further test a model that represents each document based on its propositions.
